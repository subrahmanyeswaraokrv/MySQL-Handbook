#Backup existing databases (don't skip)
Don't skip this part, it can save you a lot of trouble when something goes wrong!

Backup the databases in separate files or choose to backup your databases in a single file. Possibly the latter is easier when needing to import the backup and importing it all at once.

#Remove current MySQL version
sudo apt purge mysql-*
#Install essential packages and add apt key
sudo apt install -y dirmngr # essential package for adding apt key
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 467B942D3A79BD29
#Add MySQL 8.0 repository source
echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) mysql-8.0" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql-8.0.list
#Update apt repositories & install MySQL 8.0
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-client
#Check if MySQL 8.0 is installed
When everything goes well, you're done. MySQL version 8.0 is installed. You can verify this by checking the status of the MySQL daemon and the MySQL version:

sudo service mysql status
This should output that MySQL is active (running). To make sure you're on the new version, check the MySQL version:

sudo mysql --version
Should show something like:

mysql  Ver 8.0.31 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
