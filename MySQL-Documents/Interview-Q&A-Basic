There are 3 main ways users can interact with MySQL:

Using a command line
Through a web interface
Using a programming language
9. What are the different tables in MySQL?
They are:

MyISAM
HeapMerge
INNO DB
ISAM
10. What are MySQL Database Queries?
A query is a request for data or information from a database. Users can query a database for specific information, and the resultant record/records are returned by MySQL.  
11. What are some common MySQL commands?
Some common MySQL commands are:

CREATE – To create Table
INSERT – To insert data
JOIN – To join tables
DELETE – To delete a row from a table
ALTER – To alter database or table
BACKUP – to back up a table
DROP – To delete a database or table
CREATE INDEX – to add indexing to a column in a table
GRANT – To change user privileges
TRUNCATE – Empty a table
EXIT – to exit
12. How to create a database in MySQL?
The CREATE DATABASE command can be used to create a new database.

13. How to create table using MySQL?
The following query can be used to create a table:

CREATE TABLE 'history' (

'author' VARCHAR(128),

'title' VARCHAR(128),

'type' VARCHAR(16),

'year' CHAR(4)) 

ENGINE = InnoDB;  

A table "history" gets created in the selected database.

14. How to insert data in MySQL?
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table in MySQL. 

The two main syntaxes are:

INSERT INTO table_name (column 1, column 2, column 3,…columnN) 

VALUES (value 1, value 2, value 3,...valueN)

15. How do you remove a column form a database?
The DROP command is used to remove a column from a database.

Alter table 'history' drop column title;

16. How to create an index?
There are different types of indexes in MySQL, like a regular INDEX, a PRIMARY KEY, or a FULLTEXT index. Indexes are created on a column basis. Indexing helps to quickly search for results, either by ordering the data on disk or by telling the SQL engine which location to find your data in.

Syntax:

ALTER TABLE history ADD INDEX(author(10));

17. How do you delete data from MySQL table?
We use the DELETE statement to remove records from a table.

The syntax is as follows:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name

18. How can you view a database in MySQL?
The SHOW DATABASES command allows the user to view all databases on the MySQL server host. 

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;  

19. How to import database in MySQL?
There are two ways to import database or move data from one place to another:

Command Line Tool
MySQL Workbench
20. What are numeric data types in MySQL?
There are numeric data types for integer, fixed-point, floating-point, and bit values in MySQL. Except for BIT, the other numeric data types can be signed or unsigned.

Examples: 

INT - Standard Integer

TINYINT - Very Small Integer

SMALLINT - Small Integer

MEDIUMINT - Medium-sized Integer

BIGINT - Large Integer

DECIMAL - Fixed-point number

FLOAT - Single-precision floating-point number

DOUBLE - Double-precision floating-point number

BIT - Bit-field

21. What are string data types in MySQL?
The string data types in MySQL are:

CHAR
VARCHAR
BINARY
VARBINARY
TINYBLOB
BLOB
MEDIUMBLOB
LONGBLOB
TINYTEXT
TEXT
MEDIUMTEXT
LONGTEXT
ENUM

NULL
22. What are temporal data types in MySQL?
MySQL provides temporal data types for date and time, as well as a combination of date and time. These are:

DATE - A date value in CCYY-MM-DD Format

TIME - A Time value in hh : mm :ss format

DATETIME - Date and time value in CCYY-MM-DD hh : mm :ss format

TIMESTAMP - A timestamp value in CCYY-MM-DD hh : mm :ss format

YEAR - A year value in CCYY or YY format

23. What is BLOB?
BLOB is an acronym for a binary large object. It is a string data type used to hold a variable amount of data.

Intermediate MySQL Interview Questions
25. What are views in MySQL?
A view is a set of rows returned when a particular query is executed in MySQL. It is also known as a virtual table, which does not store any data of its own but displays data stored in other tables.

26. How to create and execute views?
The CREATE VIEW command is used to create a view in MySQL.

The syntax is:

CREATE VIEW [databasename.] view_name [(column_list)] AS select-statement;

27. What are MySQL triggers?
A task that is executed automatically in response to a predefined database event is known as a trigger. Each trigger is associated with a table and is activated by commands like INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE.

28. How many triggers are possible in MySQL?
There are 6 different types of triggers in MySQL:

Before Insert
After Insert
Before Update
After Update
Before Delete
After Delete
29. What is MySQL server?
The server 'mysqld' is the MySQL server, which performs all manipulation of databases and tables. 

30. What are the clients and utilities in MySQL?
There are several MSQL programs available to help users communicate with the server. Some important ones for administrative tasks are:

.mysql – this interactive program helps to send SQL statements to the server and view the results. One can even use MySQL to use batch scripts.

.mysqladmin – this administrative program helps perform tasks like shutting down the server, checking configuration, monitoring status if it is not functioning properly. 

.mysqldump – for backing up databases or copying them to another server

.mysqlcheck and myisamchk – these programs help perform table checking, analysis, and optimization, plus repairs for damaged tables. 

31. What types of relationships are used in MySQL?
Three types of relationships are used in MySQL:

One-to-one – items with one-to-one relation can be included as columns in the same table
One-to-many – or many-to-one relationships are seen when one row in a table is related to multiple rows in another table
Many-to-many – many rows in a table are linked to many rows in another table
