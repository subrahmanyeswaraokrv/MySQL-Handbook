Secure MySQL server:
========================
As the database is a crucial part of an application, you need to secure it. MySQL helps you do that by providing the mysql_secure_installation command.

We will now launch the secure installation script:

sudo mysql_secure_installation
The screenshot below shows the different questions asked by MySQL. Fill in and adjust based on your needs:

mysql secure installation

Letâ€™s reconnect to the server using the new root password set during the secure installation procedure.

sudo mysql -u root -p
You should now see the MySQL prompt:

mysql -user root

#Step 5: Add a new user
The installation is now complete. In order to connect any application to your database, it is recommended to create a database and a specific user and grant that user access to this database. This allows us to manage our data better.

We will create the user first:

CREATE USER 'didier'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '%$HmbKe#XeVtn8i%mX$Ha&v2on%crUWc';
Please note that the user can only connect to the database via 'localhost'. If you want the user to be able to connect from anywhere, use % instead of localhost. Be aware that this is insecure as there is no restriction based on where clients can connect.

We then flush all the privileges. This will refresh MySQL and allow us to use that user immediately.

flush privileges;
mysql user

#Step 6: Create MySQL database and grant privileges
We now proceed to create a MySQL database myapp with the following command:

 create database myapp;
We then grant the previously created user all the privileges on this database:

grant all privileges on myapp.* to 'didier'@'localhost';
mysql create database

You can now do any operation on the database.

#Step 7: Stop and restart MySQL
While managing your application, you will need to stop or restart your MySQL database.

Use the following command to stop MySQL:

sudo service mysql stop
To restart MySQL, use this command:

sudo service mysql restart
#Conclusion
In this comprehensive seven-step tutorial, we've covered how to install MySQL on Ubuntu 22.04. MySQL is a fundamental component of the LAMP stack and an integral part of many web applications and platforms. You can get further information about MySQL in the official MySQL documentation.
